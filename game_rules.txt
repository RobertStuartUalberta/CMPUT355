Welcome to the game of checkers. The game begins with Black to play.
From there players take turns moving their stones. Each turn a player can
complete one of two actions. 1: The current player may move a stone one diagonal
coordinate toward their opponents side. 2: The current player may "capture" an
opponents stone if that stone occupies a diagonal coordinate in the appropriate
direction, and the subsequent diagonal coordinate is free. If after capturing a stone
another stone can be captured by that same stone the player may do so. If either player
gets a stone to the opponents side of the board, that stone becomes a "King" and may now
move in both directions. The game ends when one player has captured all of the opponents stones.
