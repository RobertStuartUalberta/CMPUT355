Welcome to the game of checkers. 
The game begins with Black to play.
Players take turns moving their stones in one of two possible ways.
1: A player may move their stone diagonally one space so long as that space is empty and the direction is valid
2: A player may "capture" an opponents stone given the opponents stone occupies a valid move space and the subsequent space is empty.
The direction a player may move is initially toward the opponents side. 
If a player manages to get one of their stones across the board to the first row of the opponents side, that stone becomes a "king" and can now move in both directions.
In the case that a players stone captures an opponents stone, if that stone can immidiately capture another stone it may do so (this rule can stack for tripple and large captures)
The game ends when one player has captured all of the opponents stones, or a player concedes on their turn.
